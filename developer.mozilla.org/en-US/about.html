here's how we've evolved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 id="2005">2005</h4>
<p>Launched as
<a href="https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2005/02/23/devmo-and-devedge-updates/" class="external" target="_blank">DevMo by Mozilla</a>,
a community-driven wiki dedicated to documenting open web standards.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.dev/generic-content/about/screenshots/20050121103200-960x540@1x.png" alt="Screenshot of MDN homepage from January 2005" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 id="2010">2010</h4>
<p>Rebranded as
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/08/introducing-the-new-mdn-website/" class="external" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a>,
reinforcing our commitment to the developer community.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.dev/generic-content/about/screenshots/20100901014818-960x540@1x.png" alt="Screenshot of MDN homepage from September 2010" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 id="2017">2017</h4>
<p>Achieved a milestone when major tech companies began contributing and
supporting web documentation on our platform, solidifying MDN as the central
hub for web development knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 id="2020">2020</h4>
<p>Transitioned from its wiki-based origins to a modern,
<a href="https://github.com/mdn" class="external" target="_blank">GitHub-hosted project</a> with the launch of Yari,
modernizing our infrastructure and workflows.</p>
<p><img src="https://mdn.dev/generic-content/about/screenshots/20200103045709-1280x720@1x.png" alt="Screenshot of MDN homepage from October 2020" loading="lazy"></p>
</li>
<li>
<h4 id="2022">2022</h4>
<p>Unveiled a
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/03/a-new-year-a-new-mdn/" class="external" target="_blank">major redesign</a> and
introduced
<a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2022/03/introducing-mdn-plus-make-mdn-your-own/" class="external" target="_blank">MDN Plus</a>,
offering personalized features for an enhanced user experience.</p>

</li>
<li>
<h4 id="20232024">2023/2024</h4>
<p>Launched new tools, including Playground for coding experiments, AI Help for
easier content discovery, and HTTP Observatory for website security scans. We
also introduced a Blog to cover interesting topics beyond MDN’s core focus,
and a Curriculum to provide a structured approach to learning web development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="discover_more">Discover more</h4>
<p>We had fun exploring the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/developer.mozilla.org" class="external" target="_blank">internet archives</a>
and putting together a fast-forward trip through our transformation!</p>
